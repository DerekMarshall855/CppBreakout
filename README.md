# Description

I have spent some time learning OpenGL basics, this is my first project to apply those basics and make a simple game.

The game I am making is a classic, breakout.

## Goal

Have bricks that lower in HP when hit by a ball. The ball is always moving and the player can hit it back with their paddle.
